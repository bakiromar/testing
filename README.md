MEMO 3

The php and MySQL is reliant on having your XAMPP database settings set up the same way as me. To 
do this go to phpmyadmin and create a user account with the username: "admin" and the password: "localpass".
Then you need to create a database called "mutualbase", then in that databaseclick import and import the 
mutualbase.sql file. Once you have done all of these steps, the website should work on your local server 
like it does on mine.

MEMO 2

I have completely reorganized all of the files so its a bit easier to look at. The account folder
holds all account level files, and the list folder holds the list level files.

MEMO 1

For all pages with a header, all non-header content must be contained in a 'div class="container"'
The container class has a margin-top that pushes content down so it shows below the fixed header.

ATTENTION PLEASE READ

Please keep the CSS sheet organized so that when stuff starts going wrong we don't 
wanna kill ourselves finding that one tiny error in a thousand lines of code. Use comments
to keep different tags in different sections, and if you're changing an existing element
add your CSS in the section for that element (like the forms that we've done)
